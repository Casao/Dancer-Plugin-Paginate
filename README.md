# NAME

Dancer::Plugin::Paginate - HTTP 1.1 Range-based Pagination for Dancer apps.

# VERSION

Version 0.01

# DESCRIPTION

HTTP 1.1 Range-based Pagination for Dancer apps.

Provides a simple wrapper to provide pagination of results via the HTTP 1.1 Range headers for AJAX requests.

# SYNOPSIS

To use, simply add the "paginate" keyword to any route that should support HTTP Range headers.

    use Dancer::Plugin::Paginate;

    get '/secret' => paginate sub { ... }
    ...

# Configuration Options

## Ajax-Only

Options: _true|false_
Default: __true__

Determines if paginate should only operate on Ajax requests.

## Mode

Options: _headers|parameters|both_
Default: __headers__

Controls if paginate will look for the pagination in the headers, parameters, or both.

If set to both, headers will be preferred.

# Keywords

## paginate

The paginate keyword is used to add a pagination processing to a route. It will:

- Check if the request is AJAX (and stop processing if set to ajax-only).
- Extract the data from Headers, Parameters, or Both.
- Store these in vars.
- Run the provided coderef for the route.
- Add proper headers and change status to 206 if coderef was successful.

Vars:

- range - An arrayref of \[start, end\]
- range\_unit - The Range Unit provided in the request.

In your response, you an optionally provide the following vars to customize response:

- total - The total count of items. Will be replaced with '\*' if not provided.
- return\_range - An arrayref of provided \[start, end\] values in your response. Original will be reused if not provided.
- return\_range\_unit - The unit of the range in your response. Original will be reused if not provided.
